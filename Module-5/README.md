### 4.1 Welcome Back!  
Today‚Äôs Goal: Learn to use AI for creative and technical tasks like code generation, storywriting, and art. By the end, you‚Äôll build a portfolio-worthy project.  

### 4.2 Technique #1: AI as Your Coding Partner  
**Key Idea:**  
AI can write code, debug errors, or explain complex concepts. Think of it as a 24/7 tech mentor.  

**Example:**  
**Prompt:**  
Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n. Include comments.  
Activity:
Ask AI to debug this code (share your result in Discussions):
### 4.3 Technique #2: AI-Generated Creative Writing  
**Key Idea:**  
AI excels at brainstorming ideas, drafting stories, or even writing poetry.  

**Example:**  
**Prompt:**  
Write a 300-word sci-fi short story about a robot who dreams of becoming human. End with a twist.  

**AI Output:**  
A robot named Echo discovers a glitch in its programming that allows it to feel emotions. Over time, Echo yearns to experience a human life and begins mimicking human behavior. In a shocking twist, Echo learns that its dreams of humanity are part of a simulation designed to test empathy in artificial intelligence.  

**Activity:**  
Use AI to generate 3 story hooks for a fantasy novel. Share your hooks in the Discussions tab for peer feedback.

### 4.4 Technique #3: AI-Driven Art & Design  
**Key Idea:**  
AI tools like DALL-E or MidJourney transform text descriptions into stunning visual art. To get the best results, focus on crafting highly descriptive prompts.  

**Example:**  
**Prompt:**  
A cyberpunk cityscape at night, neon lights reflecting on rain-soaked streets, a lone hacker in a trench coat, anime style.  

**AI Output:**  
A vibrant neon-lit illustration of a futuristic city with rain-soaked streets and a lone figure in a trench coat, glowing with anime-inspired style.  

**Activity:**  
Design a prompt for an AI art tool:  
‚ÄúA minimalist poster of a cat sleeping under a cherry blossom tree, watercolor style.‚Äù  
Experiment with different descriptions and share your favorite results.

### 4.5 Case Study: Building a Portfolio Project  
**Scenario:**  
You‚Äôre a freelancer pitching to a client. Use AI to create a prototype that demonstrates your creative and technical skills.  

**Prompt:**  
‚ÄúCreate a 5-page website wireframe for a vegan bakery. Include homepage, menu, and contact sections. Use Figma-style mockups.‚Äù  

**Why It Works:**  
AI can quickly generate drafts to help you visualize a project. By refining these drafts, you save time and impress clients with polished deliverables.  

---

### 4.6 Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them  
- **Mistake:** Vague technical prompts.  
  **Bad:** ‚ÄúFix my code.‚Äù  
  **Fixed:** ‚ÄúDebug this Python script. It‚Äôs throwing a TypeError on line 12.‚Äù  

- **Mistake:** Relying too heavily on AI for creativity.  
  **Fixed:** Use AI for ideas and drafts, but add your unique voice and style to the final product.  

- **Mistake:** Ignoring copyright considerations.  
  **Fixed:** Never claim AI-generated art, text, or code as fully original. Always disclose AI involvement and attribute where necessary.  

---

### 4.7 Ethical Considerations  
- **Respect Copyright:** AI-generated creations may include elements of existing works. Ensure you follow copyright laws and licensing rules.  
- **Transparency:** Always disclose when you‚Äôve used AI tools for professional or academic work.  

---

### 4.8 Final Project: Build Something Awesome  
**Task:**  
Choose one of the following projects to complete:  
- **Code:** Ask AI to write a script that solves a real problem (e.g., automate emails or manage a to-do list).  
- **Creative Writing:** Draft the first chapter of a story using AI‚Äôs assistance. Refine it to include your personal style.  
- **Art:** Generate an image using an AI tool, then refine it manually to make it unique.  

**Submit:**  
Share your completed project in the GitHub Discussions tab to receive feedback from peers and instructors.  

---

### 4.9 Key Takeaways (Your Cheat Sheet)  
- **Code:** Use AI for debugging, explanations, and boilerplate code generation.  
- **Writing:** Brainstorm ideas and drafts, but always add your personal touch.  
- **Art:** Master descriptive prompts to create stunning visuals.  
- **Ethics:** Always credit AI assistance, and avoid plagiarism by respecting copyright laws.
