### 4.1 Welcome Back!  
Today’s Goal: Learn to use AI for creative and technical tasks like code generation, storywriting, and art. By the end, you’ll build a portfolio-worthy project.  

### 4.2 Technique #1: AI as Your Coding Partner  
**Key Idea:**  
AI can write code, debug errors, or explain complex concepts. Think of it as a 24/7 tech mentor.  

**Example:**  
**Prompt:**  
Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n. Include comments.  

**AI Output:**  
```python  
def fibonacci(n):  
    sequence = [0, 1]  
    for i in range(2, n):  
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])  
    return sequence[:n]
