### 2.1 Welcome Back!
**Today's Goal:** Learn advanced prompt techniques to make AI creative, analytical, and actionable. By the end, you'll write prompts that solve real problems.

### 2.2 Technique #1: The Power of Specificity
**Key Idea:**  
The more specific your prompt, the more precise the AI's output. Think of it like giving a chef a recipe vs. saying, "Make me something tasty."

**Example:**  
Vague: "Write a poem about nature."  
Specific: "Write a 14-line sonnet about a rainforest at dawn, using metaphors for sunlight filtering through leaves."

**Why It Works:**  
Specificity narrows the AI's focus, reducing ambiguity and generic responses.

**Activity:**  
Rewrite this prompt:  
"Help me plan a vacation."

**Your Turn:**  
"Create a 7-day itinerary for a budget-friendly trip to Kyoto, Japan. Include 3 cultural sites, 2 local restaurants under $20, and a day trip to Nara. Max budget: $1,500."

### 2.3 Technique #2: Adding Constraints
**Key Idea:**  
Constraints guide the AI's output format, tone, or structure. Think of it as saying, "Write this in bullet points" or "Use humor."

**Examples:**  
- "Answer in 3 bullet points, no jargon."
- "Write a LinkedIn post announcing a new AI tool, using emojis."

**Why It Works:**  
Constraints force the AI to adhere to your rules, making outputs actionable.

**Activity:**  
Add constraints to this prompt:  
"Explain quantum computing."

**Your Turn:**  
"Explain quantum computing in 2 paragraphs, using analogies to everyday objects (e.g., coins, light switches). Avoid technical terms."

### 2.4 Technique #3: Using Examples
**Key Idea:**  
Examples act as templates, showing the AI exactly what you want. Like saying, "Write like thisâ€¦"

**Example:**  
Prompt:  
Task: Summarize articles.  
Example: "Climate change is acceleratingâ€¦" â†’ "Rising temperatures threaten ecosystems."  
Now, article: "AI is transforming healthcare diagnosticsâ€¦"  
AI Output: "AI tools like MRI analysis improve early cancer detection rates."

**Why It Works:**  
Examples bypass ambiguity by giving the AI a blueprint.

**Activity:**  
Use examples to rewrite this prompt:  
"Write a product review."

**Your Turn:**  
"Act like a tech reviewer. Example: 'Product: iPhone 15. Pros: Camera quality, battery life. Cons: Price.' Now, product: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5."

### 2.5 Advanced Technique: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
**Key Idea:**  
CoT forces the AI to reason step-by-step, mimicking human problem-solving.

**Example:**  
Prompt:  
First, define the problem. Next, list 3 solutions. Finally, recommend the best one.  
Problem: My laptop battery drains quickly.  

AI Output:  
Problem: Battery drains in 2 hours.  
Solutions: a) Calibrate battery, b) Reduce screen brightness, c) Replace battery.  
Recommendation: Replace battery (most effective long-term).

**Why It Works:**  
CoT breaks complex tasks into manageable steps, improving clarity.

**Activity:**  
Use CoT for this prompt:  
"Calculate the total cost of a $200,000 house with a 10% down payment and 3% interest over 30 years."

**Your Turn:**  
"First, calculate the down payment. Next, determine the loan amount. Then, calculate monthly interest. Finally, compute the total payment over 30 years."

### 2.6 Technique #4: Role-Playing
**Key Idea:**  
Assign the AI a persona to tailor its responses (e.g., "Act like a therapist").

**Example:**  
Prompt:  
You are a career coach. Client: "I'm bored at work but scared to quit."  

AI Output:  
"Let's explore your valuesâ€¦ What excites you outside work?"

**Why It Works:**  
Personas inject creativity and empathy into responses.

**Activity:**  
Write a prompt using role-playing:  
"You are a nutritionist. Client: 'I want to lose 10 pounds in 2 months.'"

**Your Turn:**  
"Create a 12-week meal plan with 3 meals/day, focusing on whole foods. Include a sample day."

### 2.7 Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them
- **Mistake:** Overloading the prompt.  
  - Bad: "Write a poem, a recipe, and a business plan."  
  - Fixed: Split into 3 separate prompts.
- **Mistake:** Using vague adjectives.  
  - Bad: "Make it creative."  
  - Fixed: "Use metaphors and rhyme schemes."
- **Mistake:** Ignoring the AI's limits.  
  - Bad: "Predict the 2025 stock market."  
  - Fixed: "Analyze trends in renewable energy investments (data up to 2023)."

### 2.8 Hands-On Experiment
**Tools:** Use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

**Task:**  
1. Ask this prompt: "Write a blog post about AI ethics."
2. Refine it: "Write a 800-word blog post on AI bias in hiring algorithms, targeting HR managers. Include 2 case studies and actionable steps."
3. Compare outputs. Which one would you publish?

**Reflection:**  
How did constraints and specificity transform the AI's response?

### 2.9 Case Study: Solving a Real-World Problem
**Scenario:**  
A small business owner wants to create a marketing email but lacks copywriting skills.

**Prompt:**  
"You are a marketing copywriter. Task: Write a promotional email for a new organic skincare line. Target audience: eco-conscious women aged 25â€“40. Tone: Warm and empowering. Include a 15% discount code. Subject line: 'Unlock Your Natural Glow.'"

**AI Output:**  
Subject: Unlock Your Natural Glow â€“ 15% Off Your First Order!  
"Dear [Name],  
Treat yourself to nature's bestâ€¦  
Use code GLOW15 at checkout.  
Sincerely, The [Brand] Team"

**Why It Works:**  
Role-playing, constraints, and tone guidance create a polished, ready-to-use email.
